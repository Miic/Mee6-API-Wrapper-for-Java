# Mee6 API Wrapper for Java

Java 8 API Wrapper for the MEE6 Discord Bot

## What is it?
Mee6 is a Discord bot that lets you easily add your own commands to your server
through a user-friendly dashboard. A little known fact is that it has an API which other bots can reference from.

While building a bot with JDA around Mee6 player statistics, I found that there was no public wrappers for Mee6, so I built one. I thought I would share this with the community in case someone else needed it. :D
